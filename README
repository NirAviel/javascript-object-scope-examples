examples for javascript object scopes.
trying to access to the object pointer ("this") from several scopes inside and outside the object.
including two files - 
1. each scope use "this" to access the object
2. each scope use a pointer variable ("var that = this") to access the object

the script is typing the results as html to the screen and as object to the browser console.
